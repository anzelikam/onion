		Onions are cultivated and used around the world. As one of the basic vegetables in every kitchen, it is available in fresh form throughout the year.<br>Without young onions, spring simply wouldn't taste so good:))<br>
        There are many species of onions, but yellow and red are the most common. If you have decided to start your own vegetable garden, never leave out the onion!<br>
         -Why?<br>
         Simply because you can't go wrong with it! Just put a bulb in the ground and the onion will SURELY yield, even if the year is dry or the season is less favorable for vegetables.<br>
		  </p><br>
		  <div class="w3-container">
		    <h2>Some basics...</h2>
		    <p class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">
		 Onions are attacked by various diseases and pests. The worst one, in my case, is the <i class="basics">onion fly </i>that lay eggs on its leaves in the early growth stage. That way, small worms enter the bulb and damage it.<br> To prevent this I use some ordinary <i class="basics">insecticide</i> against the pests. The timing should be approximately when the onion pushes out the <i class="basics">second leaf</i>.<br>
 A good feature of onion is it <i class="basics">doesn't rot in winter</i>. Low temperatures won’t damage it. More damage is done by <i class="basics">heat and sunlight</i> during the winter. It causes <i class="basics">premature germination</i>.<br>
If <i class="basics">germination starts in January</i>, it’s a <i class="basics">good</i> sign. This means that your plant is healthy, non-GMO, and fully ready for reproduction.<br>
-Did you know that onion is a biennial plant?<br>
It means it's a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its biological life cycle.<br>
Strange, right? Because onion is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season.<br>
This brings us to the next step-the seed.

			With onion, this part gets <i class="basics">very interesting</i>.<br>
If you have an old onion in a root cellar that has <i class="basics">sprouted</i>, don’t worry! This is a very good sign that the vegetables are healthy and ready for reproduction.<br> If it’s early March, simply <i class="basics">plant</i> a few <i class="basics">such specimens</i> in the ground somewhere in your garden.<br>
In late summer, your <i class="basics">old onions</i> will <i class="basics">bloom</i> and bring in <i class="basics">many small seeds</i>. Onion bulbs are produced by sowing  these seeds in a dense pattern in early summer, then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small. Dry them and store till the next spring. These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season.<br>
As you can see, the production of young onions you so desire lasts for a full <i class="basics">two years</i>! Of course, my recommendation is to <i class="basics">start with the bulbs</i>.<br> Now that you have the seeds we can move forward!

		    If you live in the <i title="The northern temperate zone is found between the 66.50 North and 23.50 North latitudes" class="w3-blue-gray">northern temperate zone</i> as I do, you can plant onions in <i class="basics">early March</i> when the conditions for working in the garden are met. This means that the soil should be moderately moist, and relatively warm.
While this is a time when <i class="basics">frost</i> can still be expected, don’t worry! Your bulbs will handle it very <i class="basics">easily</i>.<br>
If you managed to prepare your garden in the <i class="basics">fall</i>, feel free to <i class="basics">plant onions too</i>! Bulbs will easily get through the winter. And you will have young onions as early as the first of May!<br>
Ideal soils for growing onions are the one with a medium to fine texture, warm, sandy loam, with good drainage, rich in organic matter.<br>
But it can grow almost everywhere.<br>
Water needs are higher in the first phase of development. I never watered the onions and I always had quite enough for the annual needs.<br>
To fertilize onions, use the classic NPK fertilizer. To make better use of nutrients, basic fertilization can be applied twice - the first application is before planting, and the second immediately after germination.
<br>
Planting onions is easy!<br>
Make a few rows of not too deep. Turn the roots slightly downwards and plant the bulbs in the ground. The <i class="basics">distance</i> between the bulbs should be about <i class="basics">10cm</i>.<br>
If the weather is relatively warm the onion will appear above ground in less than <i class="basics">10 days</i>.<br>
When the onion gets two or three leaves it should be treated against the pests. It is the period when the onion flies appear that lay their eggs on the onion and thus slow its development or destroy it.<br>
<i class="basics">Weed regularly</i>. <b>NEVER</b> use herbicides against weeds!
When the plants reach their final size, try not to enter between the rows to <i class="basics">avoid breaking</i> the hollow <i class="basics">leaves</i>.<br>
An interesting fact with the traditional European onion is that its bulb at the base of the plant <i class="basics">begins to swell</i> when a certain day-length is reached. In this case, that's a whole <i class="basics">14 hours</i> of a day-light!</p>

			During the growing season, the bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be stored, they are harvested after the <i class="basics">foliage dies</i> down and become dry. It is usually in the middle of summer, or spring, in the case of overwintering onions.<br>
In dry weather, they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying, then placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes.<br>
<i class="basics">Avoid</i> harvesting onions <i class="basics">after rain</i>, when the soil is wet. Retaining mud on the onion can cause the bulbs to rot.<br>
They are stored effectively in a well-ventilated, <i class="basics">cool place</i>. I store it on the attic throughout the winter. This way you can enjoy your onion up until the next season!</p><br><br>
